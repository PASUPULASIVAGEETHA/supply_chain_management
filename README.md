# 📦 Supply Chain Management Analysis
# 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing supply chain operations to uncover insights into inventory, shipping, demand, and order fulfillment efficiency. The objective is to optimize supply chain processes, reduce delays, and identify key factors that impact logistics performance.

By applying data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizations, this project highlights operational inefficiencies and provides actionable insights for better decision-making.

## Usage

- Clone this repository:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/google_playstore_app.git

Key Columns:

Order ID → Unique identifier of each order

Product Category → Type of product ordered

Order Date → Date when the order was placed

Ship Date → Date when the order was shipped

Delivery Time → Time taken for delivery

Supplier → Supplier name or ID

Region → Region of delivery

Cost → Operational/shipping cost

Revenue → Income generated per order

# 🔑 Process

Data Import – Loaded dataset using Pandas.

Data Cleaning – Removed missing values, standardized dates, formatted product categories.

Feature Engineering – Created new features like lead time, profit margin, delay status.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Analyzed supplier performance, order delays, and revenue trends.

Visualization – Built charts to identify high-demand products, regional performance, and bottlenecks.

# 📈 Key Insights

Certain regions experience higher delivery delays, impacting customer satisfaction.

Top suppliers contribute to the majority of on-time deliveries.

Profit margins vary across product categories, highlighting optimization opportunities.

Seasonal demand fluctuations impact order fulfillment efficiency.

Cost vs. Revenue analysis shows opportunities to minimize expenses in logistics.
